# Amazon Website UI Clone

This is a Amazon UI clone built with HTML and CSS, aiming to replicate the look and feel of Amazon's homepage. This project recreates key UI elements, including the header, search bar, product listings, and footer. Itâ€™s a great practice for me improving front-end design skills using HTML and CSS fundamentals.

## Screenshots

Here is the screenshots of the project:

*I tried my best to make it exactly same like Orignal.*
